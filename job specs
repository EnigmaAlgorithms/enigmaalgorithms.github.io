 ### Commisioning values common to all systems

        __ Always in a Bay__
        DROP (window drop) [mm]
        WIDTH [mm] 
        COORDINATES of BAY CENTROID
        OUTWARD OREINTION [º]

        __ Motor specific__
        VELOCITY [º/µs  µm/µs]
        DELAY_HYSTERIS_CORRECTION [µs]
        POLARITY [to swap motor operation]

        __ Device specific__
        DEVICE_TYPE
        DEVICE_NUMBER (count left to right)
        DEVICE_NAME
        DEVICE_ALIAS
        DEVICE_LOCATION

        __Enigma Stuff__
        CONTROLLER + FLOOR
        MAC ADDRESS
        SSID

## Roller blind
    ### Commisioning values

        TUBE diamter [mm]
        FABRIC thickness [mm]

        Intermediate stops. up to 'n'.
        ABSOLUTE POSITIONING or divided up by the commisioning process.
            TOP
            INT1
            INT2
            ...
            INT_N
            BOTTOM

## Venetian

    ### Commisioning values

        SLAT_WIDTH
        SLAT_PITCH
        
        OVERRUN_TRIGGER [µs]
    
    

    one revolution is the maximum overrun allowed if the AC hardstop fails.
    Fabric thickness and tube diameter..... 
    goto% vs goto_CM will require this information.
    When going down the VB first closes and the lowers. Finally the TILT
    Venetian first close then lower....
    First open then raise...
    rule of thumb 1000 ms = 90degree.
    box motor requires 168-170ms to overcome intertia. 
    This sort of locks in a minimum 15º increment for tilt.

    Runs down to the mechanical stop. where tilt is automatically 90º and then we go back to the appropriate tilt value.

    __BACnet/IP__
    Extent 0,1    binary all or nothing
    TILT
    2 separate BACnet identities.

## Rack Arm
    Sits on a fixed rack and cannot be changed
    Tubular motor runs rack arm.
    Slightly easier to set up.. 
    Like a VB but tile only with hard stops between 0 and 90.
    Again with hard stops.
    Always asyncronous AC dumb motors.
    a priori know stuff about gear ratios.
    Intermdeaite stops in angle degrees between 0 and 90º.
    Resolution shold be less than 15º but we will need to determine. Try for 5º
    (TESTS are required on the embedia controllers to see if it is possible for that resolution)

    Larger rack-arms, the intention is to use a linear actuator.
    In that case we need to know length of the lever arm. and the sweep of the actuator.

## Louvre
    ### Commisioning value
        SLAT_WIDTH
        SLAT_PITCH

    Louvres are like rack-arms that can be installed in any plane orientation
    Individual louvres can spin 360 degrees.
    Operated by linera drive/actuator or common drive train.
    Previously, louvres wereent calibrated to determine the angular displacement for each incremental lengthincrease of the actuator.
    They were operated by simpy equally dividing the runtime.

    "Repeatable intermediate stops" is what has been specified.
    We dont necessairly need to know where they are.
    This is potentially something we could do.

    Louvre will usually have stops between 0 and 90º rather than 0 -180º.
    Maybe we need an information layer sitting on the PI that track the sun location and places every Louvre
    within the system sort of tied to a 90º arc on the cardinal points. ie East side of building or west side of building.

## Spining feature

    Basically a new clas of LOUVRE that can spin 360 degrees or freely rotate for architectural wankery

## Curtain

    Pgysically running just open and closed using dry-contacts.
    Ther is a value called run-time which is determined a prioriand input into the device at commish.
    Totally dumb. We just run for a certain run time that is set at commisioning.


_______________________

PRECOMMISIONING
Settin up the number of floors and controllers, electrical drawing, etc.
The information at hand is PROJECT_NUMBER
PROJECT_ADDRESS (which popoultaes the GPS and location)
MOTOR_NUMBERS controllers, etc.

1) Enter vertical network
2) How many controllers and type per cube per floors
3) type in the physical orietnation and blind numbers (hopefully later from BIM)
    bill of quantities = number of floors, number of motors and CSV files.

ONSITE COMMISIONING
onsite time is precious and high pressure. The clients have keys to the door and want to move in.

COMMISIONING TOOL
What does it need ot do?
    GUI based hierachy building. We need to basically input all the realtionships between devices controllers and cubes.

We obscure the hiraachy f controll and MQTT from the client
The hierachy of the physical structure willl actually steer the hierachy on the IT side of things.

THe commmisioning file has to be composed.

can the tool be a quantification tool
